   ```

2. **Make a `.env` file**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following API keys and environment variables:
   ```bash
   PINECONE_API_KEY="your key here"
   PINECONE_ENV="add your region here"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your key here"
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your key here"
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your Google search engine id here"
   VOYAGE_API_KEY="your voyage api_key here"
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Usage**

1. **Run the Code**  
   After setting up your environment and keys, you can run the **Deep-Research** agent:
   ```bash
   python3 test.py
   ```

2. **Enter Your Research Query**  
   Once the script is running, you'll be prompted to the localhost link for chatbot. The agent will then break down the topic, retrieve relevant data, and give in-depth, structured responses.


### **Customizing Your Search**  
You can adjust the search parameters in the script. For example, you can modify:
